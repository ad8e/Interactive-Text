"var history_retention": how many history entries to keep by default.
for puzzle games where history matters, you may want to set this to -1, for infinite history retention.
for descriptive games, 2-5 is probably ok.
for action games which are mostly immediate and lack state, 0 for no history, or 1 for single history, is ok. 0 is also good when state persists across frames.

I decided to use single quotes in the html file. Before, there was a mix which depended on where I copy-pasted code from.
I like not having to hold down shift.
Maybe there is some inconsequential compression benefit (there are single quotes in contractions).

Most websites use double quotes, and consistency with them is good.
Double quotes are quotations in English too, and in C++.
Double quotes means that contractions inside text don't cause problems. In retrospect, this was the biggest factor and so single quotes were a mistake. But I'm too lazy to change it back now.

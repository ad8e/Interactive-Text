[options] can't be tabbable after the game starts or the user will be annoyed when scroll jumps, and it shouldn't have a fixed keybind. thus, its tabindex is only valid at the very beginning.
	well, you can leave it tabbable if you want. 
this script grays out options and make them non-tabbable. if desired, you can add code in C++ to call this function after the user clicks the first link. if you want them to be non-tabbable always, this script is not necessary, just make their tabindex='-1'


<script type='text/javascript'>
function remove_options_focus()
{
	var options_panel = document.getElementById("options_section");
	options_panel.style.opacity = 0.6;
	var options_elements = options_panel.getElementsByTagName('*');
	for (var i = 0; i < options_elements.length; ++i) {
		options_elements[i].setAttribute('tabindex', '-1');
		//option.removeAttribute('tabindex'); //doesn't work in chrome, because they're selectable by default without having tabindex
		//options_elements[i].tabindex = -1; //this doesn't work
		//options_elements[i].tabindex = '-1'; //this doesn't work
	}
}
</script>

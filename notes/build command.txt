	"--memory-init-file 0" plus "-s WASM=0" lets Chrome run it locally, at slight cost to file size
	even with "--memory-init-file 0", local files still won't work on IE without the local webserver, because IE runs into another roadblock of not supporting localStorage for local html files.
	-s ELIMINATE_DUPLICATE_FUNCTIONS=1 is nearly insignificant
	-s POLYFILL_OLD_MATH_FUNCTIONS is for IE

--closure 1 reduces filesize by maybe 20kb but is annoying to use.

strongly recommend to copy paste the first-view text of main_body and place it in the html file. it will be duplicated, but this shaves off 0.2s on the first-view. calling Module._i() before it's loaded causes a brief error but it's completely recovered from.

before, the precompiled builds were not updated. but now they are.
git pull
./emsdk update-tags
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate latest
source ./emsdk_env.sh

if you want to build from source, which is no longer necessary, use sdk-incoming-64bit

if compiling, raise linux vm RAM. 4072 MB not enough. 4.5GB enough.
